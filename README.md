# mnist_with_virtual_interface
# Description 
This is a multi class classification problem were we have to classify handwritten digits into 9 different classes. 
I have trained a deep neural network in it and achived an accuracy of 99% on the test data. 
But the way we provide input to the trained model is what make it different from others. 
I have made the virtual interface using opencv to provide handwritten digits to the model for classification.
I am doing the contour detection of blue color object to provide a handwritten digit as input to the trained model.
